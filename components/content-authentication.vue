                    {{apiName}} uses tokens to authenticate requests. These tokens are computed automatically by
                    {{apiName}} when the page is visited.
                    Tokens are loaded with time and calls when you <a class="internal"
                                                                      href="#subscriptions">subscribe</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a token has been loaded, it can be <a href="#manage-subscription">renewed, cancelled and
                    managed.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make an request, just pass the token in the query string as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code class="inline">https://api-url?token=<span class="accent-hard">YOUR_TOKEN</span></code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your token in
                    publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without
                    authentication will also fail.
                    There is a daily limit of a few unauthenticated calls which can be used to test the API.
